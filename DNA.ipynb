Just as a typo in a book can change its meaning, mutations in DNA can change the proteins it codes for, leading to different traits in living organisms. Today, we'll step into the shoes of evolutionary biologists and explore how even small changes in DNA sequences can lead to dramatic variations in the appearance of the affected organism.
